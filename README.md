# Support-and-Resistance
Support and resistance are two fundamental concepts in technical analysis, which is a method of predicting future price movements in financial markets based on historical price data.

It's important to note that support and resistance levels are not fixed and can change over time as market dynamics shift. Additionally, it's common for support levels to become resistance levels once they are broken, and vice versa. This phenomenon is known as "role reversal."
